# REST API Template

This is a starter template for creating RESTful APIs using TypeScript, Node.js, and Express. 

## Features

- TypeScript for type safety
- Express for handling routes and middleware
- MongoDB with Mongoose for database interaction
- CORS middleware for handling cross-origin requests
- Multer for handling file uploads
- Dotenv for managing environment variables
- ts-node-dev for development

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up your MongoDB connection in `.env` (create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`).
4. Run the development server using `npm run start`.
5. Access the API at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains TypeScript source files.
  - `controllers/`: Controllers for handling API routes.
  - `models/`: Mongoose models for database schema.
  - `routes/`: API routes.
  - `middlewares/`: Custom middleware functions.
  - `index.ts`: Entry point for the application.
- `dist/`: Compiled JavaScript files (generated by TypeScript).

## Scripts

- `npm run start`: Start the development server using `nodemon`.
- `npm run build`: Compile TypeScript files to JavaScript.
